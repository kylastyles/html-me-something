        <h3>The Winding Road to Coding Success</h3>
        <article>
            <p>At a very young age, Kyla discovered her love for literature and the power of words to craft 
                narrative landscapes. She spent the summer vacations of her youth finishing off the untouched 
                sections of her school&#39;s vocabulary workbooks, laying the foundation for an extensive 
                vocabulary and strong writing skills.</p> 
            
            <p>During high school, Kyla charged into the Junior Reserve Officers&#39; Training Corp (JROTC). 
                As the junior information officer, she wrote journalism pieces to distribute to the school 
                newspaper. In her community, she searched for lost individuals with an Explorer Scout troop 
                participating in Appalachian Search and Rescue missions. These experiences taught her to 
                respect leadership, follow meticulous direction, and teamwork. The same way she searched for 
                small clues in the tangled underbrush back then, now she seeks out errors and refines code.</p>
            
            <p>As a Sophomore, Kyla won a statewide essay contest for her submission &#8220;Maryland in the Civil War: 
                Leaders on Behalf of the Nation.&#8221; She earned an internship at the Maryland Archives, logging data 
                from boxes of random lunch menus and guest lists from state galas into a database. This experience 
                proved key to her success in a later job (as seen below).</p>
            
            <p>After graduation, Kyla joined a school venture to visit Japan. As the only member of the group who had 
                chosen Japanese for a foreign language credit, Kyla helped the group find their way around the country. 
                She speaks very little Japanese now, but will never stop watching subtitled anime. She strives to emulate 
                the Japanese aesthetic of elegant minimalism in clean, concise code.</p>
            
            <p>Kyla has an Associate of Fine Arts degree in Visual Communications (graphic design) from the 
                Maryland College of Art and Design (MCAD). She submitted a clay figurine for a gallery show 
                and earned a Presidential Merit Scholarship to the school. She was awarded the honor of being 
                recognized in &#8220;Who&#39;s Who Among Students in American Junior Colleges, 2002.&#8221; While at MCAD and 
                her next school, Ringling School of Art and Design, Kyla learned to use Adobe After Effects, 
                Dreamweaver, Illustrator, InDesign, and Photoshop. To this day she still does freelance design 
                work, mostly on Illustrator.</p>
            
            <p>One of Kyla&#39;s first experiences in the corporate world was as the singular file clerk to a 
            human services organization. Kyla&#39;s job was to know the location and condition of every file in multiple 
            rooms in several buildings. Though electronic records had not yet become the norm in healthcare at the 
            time, based on her prior experience at the Maryland Archives, Kyla realized there was great potential for 
            a database to log the files. Though Kyla tried, she did not know how to create a true, relational 
            database, so she settled for a single page spreadsheet. While large and cumbersome, that spreadsheet 
            increased her job productivity by 100%. Kyla still dreams to one day build a SQL database from scratch.</p> 
            
            <p>Kyla&#39;s next endeavor took her to Las Vegas to learn massage and bodywork. After graduating 
                with a certificate from the Nevada School of Massage Therapy, Kyla started her own massage business. She 
                self-promoted and created marketing materials for her business. She listened to clients&#39; 
                concerns and addressed their needs, methodically working knots out of muscle fibers the same way she now 
                picks bugs out of code. The interconnectivity of the musculoskeletal system of the human body is not so 
                different from the arrangement of a good computer program. Kyla understands that poking one muscle or 
                line of code can effect the balance of the entire system; homeostasis is key.</p>
            
            <p>Currently, Kyla is a stay at home mom, cultivating patience and calm under pressure while trying 
                to raise two munchkins to be upstanding individuals. When her youngest child finally started school, 
                Kyla also went to school! She is learning Python, HTML5, CSS, Javascript, and C#. She can't wait to 
                bring her varied skillset to the workforce!</p>
