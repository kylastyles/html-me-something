        <h2>About Kyla</h2>
        <h3>A Work Biography in Three Parts</h3>

        <h3>Prologue</h3>
        
        <p>Imagine, if you will, a struggling graphic design student named Kyla. She had been at the top of her class in a small, two-year art school, but after graduating with an AFA degree, her trusted mentors encouraged her to continue her education at another art institution. Kyla&#39;s work was not so well received at the new school. After two years of spinning her wheels on projects that elicited sneers from the teachers, Kyla was stressed out, out of money, and out of creative ideas. It was time for a reset.</p>

        <h3>Part I</h3>
        <h4>In Which Kyla Enters the Corporate World</h4>
        <p>Kyla returned home and joined her mother at her place of employment, a non-profit organization that provides human services to individuals with various needs. As the singular file clerk to this large organization, Kyla was responsible for knowing the location and condition of every file in multiple rooms in multiple buildings. Electronic records had not yet been established as the norm in healthcare, but Kyla realized there was great potential for the thousands of paper files to be logged in a database. She had spent one summer of her high school career at the Maryland Archives, logging data from boxes of random lunch menus and guest lists from state galas; why couldn&#39;t the organization&#39;s files be logged the same? With approval from management, Kyla instituted a single page spreadsheet that increased her job productivity by 100%. Whenever a case manager called to inquire on the whereabouts of a client&#39;s file, Kyla could look it up in seconds. While the spreadsheet did the job well, it was large and cumbersome to work with. Kyla knew a database would be easier to manipulate, but unfortunately, though she tried, she did not know how to create a true, relational database. Management did not approve her repeated requests to learn SQL.</p>

        <h3>Part II</h3>
        <h4>In Which Kyla Becomes a Massage Therapist (Yes, Really)</h4>
        <p>After reaching her pinnacle as a file clerk and denied the opportunity for further learning, Kyla switched gears and left the company to attend massage school in Las Vegas. Her beloved aunt was a massage therapist, and it looked like wonderfully fulfilling work. It really was. As a self-employed licensed massage therapist and bodyworker, Kyla nourished her soul by helping relieve her clients&#39; pain, and she even got to express her artistic side by creating her own marketing materials. Massage is expensive business, though; the ratio of outgoing money for expenses (rent, lotions, continuing education, license renewal, etc) versus the incoming money for services rendered (five massages per day) left Kyla sore and just scraping even. After three years, Kyla abandoned her massage business to become a mother. She would figure out what to do next after the children grew up.</p>

        <h3>Part III</h3>
        <h4>In Which Kyla Learns to Code</h4>
        <p>The day finally came when Kyla&#39;s youngest child started Kindergarten. What would she do now? She had a vague idea that she wanted to work with computers, maybe in IT Security like her husband. But that unfinished database from so many years ago still haunts her; the desire to learn SQL is just as strong now as it was then. So Kyla joined the inaugural LaunchCode opportunity in Tampa. She is learning Python, javascript, HTML, CSS, C#, and maybe even a bit of SQL all in a period of six months! It is a large undertaking, but Kyla feels up to the task. She looks forward to one day bringing her artistic/problem-solving/people-pleasing skills to the workforce.</p>
