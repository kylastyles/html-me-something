                            <a href="https://cms.montgomerycollege.edu/arts-tpss/sa-d/">Maryland College of Art and Design</a>. She won a Presidential Merit Scholarship based on 
                            a clay figurine she had submitted to a gallery show. While in school, Kyla learned 
                            to use Adobe After Effects, 
                            Dreamweaver, Illustrator, InDesign, and Photoshop.</p>

                        <p>One of Kyla&#39;s first experiences in the corporate world was as the singular file clerk to a 
                            human services organization. Her job duties included knowing the status and location of every file in multiple 
                            rooms in several buildings. Electronic records had not yet become the norm in healthcare at the 
                            time, but an experience from her past gave her an idea: after winning a statewide essay contest, Kyla&#39;s prize included an internship at the <a href="http://msa.maryland.gov/">Maryland State Archives</a>, logging data 
                            into a database. If boxes of random lunch menus and guest lists from state galas could be saved electronically, why couldn&#39;t the organization&#39;s file details? Though Kyla tried, she did not know how to create a true, relational 
                            database, so she settled for a single page spreadsheet. While large and cumbersome, that spreadsheet 
                            increased her job productivity by 100%. Kyla still aspires to one day build a SQL database from scratch.</p>

                        <p>After graduating 
                            from the <a href="http://www.nevadasmt.com/">Nevada School of Massage Therapy</a> and obtaining state and national licensure, Kyla started a massage therapy 
                            business. She 
                            self-promoted and created marketing materials to grow her business. She listened to clients&#39; 
                            concerns and addressed their needs, methodically working knots out of muscle fibers the same way she now 
                            picks bugs out of code. The interconnectivity of the musculoskeletal system of the human body is not so 
                            different from the skeleton of a good computer program. Kyla understands that prodding one muscle or 
                            line of code can affect the balance of the entire system, so moderate changes are ideal.</p>

                            Kyla went back to school, too. With <a href="http://www.launchcode.org">LaunchCode</a> she learned Python3, HTML5, CSS, Javascript, and C#. She is ready to
